# Songyy Bot

A discord bot with support for playlists

## Yet another discord bot?

This bot is different, the problem it ~~tries~~ to solve is when you don't have patience
for searching songs in the middle of your Dungeons and Dragons adventure with
your friends and the group really likes songs when playing.

You **pre configure** all the things you will need, like a playlist for a forest,
a playlist for a battle in the forest and so on.

The api to provide usage is currently in *beta* and not finished, but you can
check it out in [songyy-api](https://github.com/gabrielpetry/songyy-api).


## Fell free to contact, help and suggest improvements to the project ;)
